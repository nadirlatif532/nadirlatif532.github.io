It's nice to associate a face with a name. Hello I'm Nadir Latif, a Computer Science grad from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus with a passion for everything related to Games and Game-dev. Recently I've started dabbling in Machine Learning and have fallen in love with it. 

I still consider myself a novice so with time I hope I'll have more to tell about myself in the futuree and maybe even showcase it here. feel free to contact me at **nadirlatif532@gmail.com** if you have any queries whatsoever.
