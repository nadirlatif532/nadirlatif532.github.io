It's nice to associate a face with a name. I'm Nadir Latif, a Computer Science grad from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus with a passion for everything related to Games and Game-dev. Recently I've started dabbling in Machine Learning and have fallen in love with it.

### What I'm doing/reading currently:
* Reading Deep Learning by Ian  Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. (You should read it too. it's available for free online at [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org "Deep Learning")
* Enrolled in the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai at Coursera. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning "Deep Learning Specialization")
* Enrolled in the Game Development Specialization by Michigan State University. [Game Design & Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development "Game Design and Development Specialization")
* Going through CS231 MIT. [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.http://cs231n.stanford.edu "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition")

I still consider myself a novice so I hope I'll have more to tell about myself in the future and maybe even showcase it here. feel free to contact me at **nadirlatif532@gmail.com** if you have any queries whatsoever.
