There are not a lot of life lessons I live by but the one aforementioned is something I deeply believe in. Throughout my life I've set out goals for myself and try to achieve them. This blog is another one of those goals. The main purpose of this blog is to document everything I learn from this day forward. Which will majorly consist of my work as a Computer Science Grad who loves Game Development and Machine Learning. This indecisiveness of mine will be clearly visible on my posts as they will dabble in both disciplines. So, buckle up!

Aside from work related posts I will also write about experiences which I believe will be beneficial to the reader and to me in the future. So suit up and Geronimo!
